        <h2>Smile :)</h2>
        <h4>Letâ€™s Start with saying Happy Anniversary to both of you, it didnâ€™t even feel a Year feels like it was just a month ago. Your wedding has been the most interesting part of my life, and definitely of yours as well. I just wanted to say that on the wedding day, when you both were standing at the time of entry, I canâ€™t even frame a sentence about how happy I was feeling that day. All that your struggles were giving their best result. Thank God, you guys didnâ€™t do Baby-Shona things. ðŸ˜‚<br><br>

            I admire you both as the couple, I never felt like husband and wife but just to best friends at fighting ðŸ˜‚. I have always felt blessed to get a brother like you, but never felt that there would be someone I feel equally happy with.  I donâ€™t know how, but you guysâ€™ tackle everything with a smile. Whenever I feel like not talking to anyone or sad, you both are my charming factor. I guess my all tensions, stress just vanishes away when I see you guys.<br><br> 
            I have seen you guys stand with each other in your hard times, and this is the best and strong bond I have seen till now. HATs Off to what you guys have dealt with, I donâ€™t think any other thing than â€˜POWER OF BONDâ€™ could withstand that. <br><br>
            But finally, it all started well, You guys got what you wanted, thatâ€™s what matters the most. Ok ab Jyada ho raha hai, toh would just finish by saying I hope you fight more (Interesting show for me at least) ðŸ˜‚ but, have the strongest bond and stand with each other as you do now as well.
            Wishing you a <br>VERY HAPPY FIRST ANNIVERSARY<br> and keep the smile that I always see on your faces, alive.
